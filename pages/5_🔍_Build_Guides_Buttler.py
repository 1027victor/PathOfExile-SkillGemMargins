        Here's a rough **sketch** of what I'd try to include in a new tool:\n
        - **Multiple Build Sources**: YT, PoE Forums, Websites, Reddit, tc.
        - **Filter Options**: Classes, Ascendancies, Skills, etc.
        - **Add some Analytics**: Show view count, comments, upvote/downvote-ratio
        - **Sanity checks**: unique items in the build cost at least X divines, guide was updated on date Y the last time,?  
        - **Collaboration Opportunity**: You have killed Uber Elder with the build or just wants to show its playstyle? Simply attach a video-of-proof and the corresponding pob to the guide you follow!
