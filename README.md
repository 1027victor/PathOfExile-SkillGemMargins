Hello and welcome to [PoE Academy](https://www.youtube.com/c/PoEAcademy)'s Toolbox where I gather and create my own little programs for Path of Exile. If you don't know the game, better leave now. 

If you know it, chances are high that you also know poe.ninja. I'm using its data to create small but helpful tools for the community. Currently there are two programs: One to find the gems with the highest leveling margins and one to roll sextants. The results are displayed using streamlit which let's you interact with the data yourself. 

To view the results, follow this link: [https://poeacademy.streamlit.app](https://poeacademy.streamlit.app)

The data from poe.ninja and also TFT is fetched on a daily basis.
