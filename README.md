This is a little program made for Path of Exile. If you don't know the game, you can leave now. 

If you know it, chances are high that you also know poe.ninja. I've used its API to fetch skill gem data, which I then use to find the gems with the highest leveling margins. The results are displayed with streamlit which let's you interact with the data yourself. 

To view the results, follow this link: bit.ly/3xb0slP

The data from poe.ninja is fetched on a daily basis.
