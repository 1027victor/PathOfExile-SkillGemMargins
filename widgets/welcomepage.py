    Welcome fellow Exile, glad to have you here! This is my 'website'! My plan is to gather a couple of 
    useful tools for you and to create some PoE-related tools myself!\n 
    - **Regarding community tools:** I will add all the tools I use myself (use them at your own risk!) to a single place for our convenience. Say adieu to searching. \n 
    - **Regarding my own crafts:** Each one will have its dedicated page and I will update old work on new tools whenever my family allows me to do so. \n 
    Sounds great? ''')
